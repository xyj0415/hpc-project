cpu_serialized.cpp
	- Serialized version of GOL
cpu_parallelized.cpp
	- MPI version of GOL
cpu_parallelized2.cpp
	- MPI version of GOL, with data compression 
gpu.cu
	- CUDA version of GOL, uses 2d grid and 2d block
gpu2.cu
	- CUDA version of GOL, uses 1d grid and 1d block, with bitwise optimization

Use "make" to compile all the source files.
	*Please make sure you have OpenMPI and Cuda loaded
To run the serialized version:
	./cpu_serialized [dimension] [iterations]
To run the MPI version:
	mpirun -np [num of nodes] ./cpu_parallelized [dimension] [iterations]
To run the cuda version:
	./gpu [dimension] [iterations] [block size]
